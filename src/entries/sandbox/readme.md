This sandbox is a critical application component which allows us to perform the unsafe evaluations that we require for decoding and evaluating candid values into javascript values within our extension. Use of eval is disallowed elsewhere in the extension, so we create a safe sandbox which can perform these operations. The main execution thread will make requests to this sandbox for funtionality requiring these additional capabilities, and the sandbox will return responses to those requests, via the [window messages api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage).
